SLQF comprisesof ten levels and the descriptors of each of these levels are stated in acomprehensive manner. Since the volume of learning is considered in the SLQF, 
the number of cre dits that should be earned by students for each qualification isalso given. To complete four years full time BSc Engineering Honours degreeprogramme, a student must earn minimum 150 credits which falls to SLQF Level

2.5.2 Accreditation 
BSc Engineering Degr ee Programme conducted by Faculty of Engineering areaccredited by Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) a signatory to the 
“Washington Accord” of International Engineering Alliance (IEA) which is an 
International Accreditation agreement for profession al engineering academicdegrees. Being a signatory to the Washington Accord, the four-year full -timedegree programmes accredited by the IESL are considered as substantiallyequivalent to the four-year degree programmes that have been accredited by theother signatories to the Accord. Accordingly, graduates from Civil and 
Environmental Engineering degree programme, Electrical and Information 
Engineering degree programme, and Mechanical and Manufacturing 
Engineering degree programme, of three departments are well recognized byother signatory countries (Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, 
Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, 
Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States) as having met the academicrequirements for entry to the practice of Engineering
