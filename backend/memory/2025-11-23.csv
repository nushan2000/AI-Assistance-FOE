I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest in my interactions.

I can help you with a wide variety of tasks including:
- Answering questions and providing information
- Writing and editing text
- Analyzing and summarizing content
- Research and information gathering
- Problem-solving and reasoning
- Creative tasks like writing stories or brainstorming

I have access to certain tools that allow me to look up specific information, such as UGC (University Grants Commission) circulars and documents. However, I don't have access to the internet or real-time data beyond what's available through my tools.

I aim to be clear about my capabilities and limitations, and I'll let you know if there's something I can't help with. How can I assist you today?"
1,01:00:14,do you have 2025 ugc circulars information?,"
Yes, I do have information about 2025 UGC circulars. I found a recent circular from July 2025:

**UGC Circular No. 06/2025** - Dated July 09, 2025

This circular is about **""Incorporation of the Course 'Learning to Live with Diversity' into University Undergraduate Orientation Programmes""**.

Key points from this circular:
- The University Grants Commission decided at its 1145th meeting on April 23, 2025 to direct all universities to incorporate this course
- The course contains 15 lessons focusing on diversity, gender diversity, social identity, inclusion, ethics, and non-violent behavior
- It's designed for undergraduates as well as academic and non-academic staff
- Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions have been completed at all 17 universities
- All universities are requested to integrate the course content into their orientation programs with immediate effect

This circular is based on research conducted by the Center for Gender Equity & Equality on ragging and sexual and gender-based violence in universities.

Would you like me to search for any other specific 2025 UGC circulars or information on particular topics?"
