Yes, I do have information about 2025 UGC circulars. I found a recent circular from July 2025:

**UGC Circular No. 06/2025** - Dated July 09, 2025

This circular is about **""Incorporation of the Course 'Learning to Live with Diversity' into University Undergraduate Orientation Programmes""**.

Key points from this circular:
- The University Grants Commission decided at its 1145th meeting on April 23, 2025 to direct all universities to incorporate this course
- The course contains 15 lessons focusing on diversity, gender diversity, social identity, inclusion, ethics, and non-violent behavior
- It's designed for undergraduates as well as academic and non-academic staff
- Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions have been completed at all 17 universities
- All universities are requested to integrate the course content into their orientation programs with immediate effect

This circular is based on research conducted by the Center for Gender Equity & Equality on ragging and sexual and gender-based violence in universities.

Yes, I found some information about UGC circulars for both 2025 and 2024. However, the text appears to have some formatting or encoding issues that make it difficult to read clearly.

**For 2025 UGC Circulars:**
