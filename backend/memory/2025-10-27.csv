Based on the information available from the Faculty of Engineering resources, I cannot provide a definitive answer about repeating core modules when you already have 150+ credits. The search results show that:

1. Core modules are essential components of the curriculum (15 modules carrying 36 credits)
2. The minimum graduation requirement is 150 credits at SLQF Level 7

However, the specific policy regarding repeating core modules when exceeding the credit requirement is not clearly stated in the available search results.

For accurate information about:

1,23:18:32,What are the key factors that determine the choice of a procurement method according to the Procurement Guidelines?,"

The key factors determining the choice of procurement method according to the Procurement Guidelines are:

### **Primary Factors**
1. **Nature of Goods/Services**: Suitability of the procurement method for specific goods, works, or services.
2. **Procurement Value**: The financial scale of the project.
3. **Local Availability and Cost**: Accessibility and affordability of resources in the region.
4. **Critical Delivery Dates**: Timelines for completion or delivery requirements.
5. **Funding Agency Agreements**: Compliance with stipulations from funding bodies.
6. **Transparency of Procedures**: Ensuring open and accountable processes.

### **Evaluation Criteria for Bids**
Additional factors considered during bid evaluation include:
- Delivery schedules or completion timelines.
- Equipment efficiency, capacity, and spare parts availability.
- After-sales services and payment terms.
- Operating costs, life cycle costing, and currency conversion.
- Domestic preferences, cross discounts for combined lots.
- Bidder experience, qualifications, and alternate bids.

### **Strategic Considerations**
Procurement planning involves iterative adjustments to:
- Contract packaging (structuring contracts into manageable lots).
- Scheduling (aligning procurement timelines with project needs).
- Method selection (balancing flexibility and compliance with guidelines).

These factors ensure alignment with project objectives while adhering to procurement policies."
1,23:20:27,In what situations might a Procuring Entity (PE) choose International Competitive Bidding (ICB) over National Competitive Bidding (NCB)?,"

Based on the Procurement Guidelines, a Procuring Entity (PE) would choose International Competitive Bidding (ICB) over National Competitive Bidding (NCB) in the following situations:

## **Primary Situations for Choosing ICB:**

### **1. Large-Scale Contracts**
- **ICB is most suited for large contracts valued at Rs. 300 million or more**
- For goods contracts exceeding Rs. 50 million in emergency/rehabilitation operations

### **2. Limited Domestic Capacity**
- **When the capacity of domestic contractors, suppliers, and service providers is limited**
- When domestic industry cannot meet the technical or financial requirements of the project

### **3. Foreign Funding Requirements**
- **For Foreign Funded Projects when the Foreign Funding Agency agreement requires the PE to resort to ICB procedures**
- When international competition is mandated by funding conditions

### **4. Need for Maximum Competition**
- When the PE needs to give all prospective and qualified bidders adequate and timely notifications
- When worldwide publicity is required to ensure maximum competition and fair opportunity

### **5. Cost Considerations**
- When goods or services are not available within Sri Lanka at prices significantly below international markets
- When international competition is expected to yield better value, quality, or technical solutions

## **Contrast with NCB:**

NCB would typically be chosen when:
- Goods or works are available within Sri Lanka at prices significantly below international markets
- For most GOSL funded projects with domestic availability
- Works contracts exceeding Rs. 10 million or goods contracts not exceeding Rs. 100 million (in emergency situations)

The choice ultimately depends on the nature and size of the project, local availability, critical delivery dates, funding agency agreements, and the need for transparency in procedures."
