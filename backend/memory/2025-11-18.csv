I don't have access to current car pricing information through my available tools. My resources are focused on university-related documents like exam manuals, student handbooks, by-laws, and procurement guidelines.

For the most accurate and up-to-date Benz car prices, I'd recommend checking:
- Official Mercedes-Benz website
- Automotive pricing sites like Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds
- Local car dealerships
- Automotive comparison websites

Car prices can vary significantly based on the specific model, year, trim level, location, and current market conditions."

1,23:34:52,What are the minimum requirements for graduation?,"
Based on the student handbook, here are the minimum requirements for graduation:

## **Credit Requirements**

### **1. Category-Based Credit Requirements:**
- **Engineering Design and Projects:** Minimum 8 credits
  - Modules include ME 3110, ME 3201, ME 4303, MN 7411, MN 8305
- **Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts and Engineering Ethics:** Minimum 5 credits
  - Modules include IS3322, IS4121, IS4123, IS4126, IS4227, MN8113

### **2. Industrial Training:**
- **Minimum 5 credits** required from Industrial Training
- Must be completed with a grade of 'Pass-H' (Excellent), 'Pass-M' (Good), or 'Pass-S' (Satisfactory)
- **Graduation will be withheld** if Industrial Training is not successfully completed

## **Academic Requirements**

### **3. Residence Requirement:**
- **Four academic years** as a duly registered full-time student of the University

### **4. Specialization Requirements:**
- **Minimum 18 total credits** required to register for specialization courses
- All modules in the Common Core Course must be passed with at least grade 'C'

## **GPA Requirements for Class Awards**

While these determine the class of degree rather than minimum graduation requirements:
- **First Class:** GPA ≥ 3.70
- **Second Class Upper Division:** 3.30 ≤ GPA < 3.70
- **Second Class Lower Division:** 3.00 ≤ GPA < 3.30

## **Additional Notes:**
- The requirements must satisfy both IESL accreditation requirements and faculty graduation requirements
- Individual cases may be dealt with on their own merits by the Faculty Board with Senate approval
- Students who fail modules must reattempt them to achieve at least grade 'C' level

These requirements ensure that graduates have both the technical expertise through engineering design projects and the broader perspective through humanities and ethics courses, plus practical experience through industrial training."
