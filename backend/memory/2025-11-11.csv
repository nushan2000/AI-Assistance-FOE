1,09:16:36,How is bid evaluation carried out according to the NPA manual?,"
Based on the procurement guidelines I found, here's how bid evaluation is carried out according to the relevant manual:

## Bid Evaluation Process

### **Main Objective**
The primary goal of bid evaluation is to determine the bid that will result in the **lowest evaluated cost** to be incurred by the Procuring Entity (PE) among the substantially responsive bids received from qualified bidders.

### **Key Principles**

1. **Substantially Responsive Concept**: Instead of requiring fully compliant bids, the evaluation uses a ""substantially responsive"" concept. This means bids that don't fully comply with all requirements can still be considered if the departures don't materially affect the outcome.

2. **Fairness and Transparency**: Bid evaluation is the step most vulnerable to manipulation, so it must be conducted correctly and fairly to ensure the process integrity.

### **Required Documentation**

The bidding documents must contain:
- A statement on how bids will be evaluated
- A listing of factors other than price to be considered
- Explanation of the method for applying evaluation factors (both for monetary adjustments and other criteria)

### **Evaluation Criteria**

Other than price and substantial responsiveness, evaluation may consider:
- Arithmetical errors
- Omissions
- Delivery schedule/completion time
- Equipment efficiency
- Capacity
- Spare parts availability
- After-sales services
- Payment schedule
- Operating costs
- Life cycle costing
- Currency conversion
- Domestic preferences
- Discounts for combination of lots
- Experience and qualifications of bidders
- Alternate bids

### **Detailed Evaluation Process**

1. **Screening**: Only bids determined to be substantially responsive (without material deviations) are considered for detailed evaluation.

2. **Comparison**: During detailed evaluation, bids are compared with each other to determine the lowest evaluated cost.

3. **Methodology**: Only evaluation criteria disclosed in the bidding documents can be used. No additional criteria should be applied.

4. **Systematic Approach**: A logical and systematic sequence must be followed during detailed evaluation and comparison.

**Note**: While this information comes from procurement guidelines rather than specifically an ""NPA manual,"" these procedures represent standard bid evaluation practices that would likely be similar in the NPA manual context."
1,09:18:16,What are the thresholds for different procurement methods?,"
Based on the procurement guidelines, here are the thresholds for different procurement methods:

## **Works Procurement Thresholds**

| Contract Value | Procurement Method | Approval Committee |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **≥ Rs. 250 million** | International Competitive Bidding (ICB) | Main Procurement Committee (MPC) |
| **≥ Rs. 100 million and < Rs. 250 million** | National Competitive Bidding (NCB) | District Procurement Committee/Technical Evaluation Committee (DPC/TEC) |
| **< Rs. 100 million** | Limited National Bidding - Option 1 | Regional Procurement Committee/Technical Evaluation Committee (RPC/TEC) |
| **< Rs. 25 million** | Limited National Bidding - Option 2 | Regional Procurement Committee (RPC) |
| **< Rs. 2.5 million** | Force Account | RPC Works |

## **Goods Procurement Thresholds**

| Contract Value | Procurement Method | Approval Committee |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **≥ Rs. 100 million** | International Competitive Bidding (ICB) | DPC/TEC |
| **< Rs. 100 million** | National Competitive Bidding (NCB) | RPC/TEC |
| **< Rs. 3.0 million** | Shopping | RPC Goods |
| **< Rs. 1.0 million** | Direct Contract | RPC/TEC |

## **Contract Agreement Requirements**

- **Works/Service Contracts**: Written contract agreements required for contracts exceeding **Rs. 100,000**
- **Goods Contracts**: Written contract agreements required for contracts exceeding **Rs. 1 million**

## **Important Notes**

1. **No Single Contract Limit**: No single contract shall exceed Rs. 250 million
2. **Contract Splitting**: Splitting large contracts to circumvent higher approval thresholds is considered highly irregular and requires prior approval from the appropriate higher-level committee
3. **Documentation**: For contracts below the written agreement thresholds, purchase orders or other appropriate written documents may be used

These thresholds ensure appropriate oversight and control based on the value and complexity of the procurement, with higher-value contracts requiring more rigorous evaluation and approval processes."
1,09:20:42,What are the main steps in the national procurement process?,"
Based on the procurement guidelines, here are the main steps in the national procurement process:

## **Main Steps in the National Procurement Process**

### **Phase 1: Preparation and Planning**
1. **Define Requirements** - Define the works, services, or supply requirements
2. **Form Procurement Committee/TEC** - Establish the appropriate procurement committee
3. **Prepare Bidding Documents** - Develop all necessary bidding documentation
4. **Scrutinize & Approve Bidding Documents** - Review and approve the bidding documents

### **Phase 2: Pre-Qualification (If Required)**
5. **Prepare Pre-Qualification Documents** - Develop pre-qualification criteria and documents
6. **Approve Pre-Qualification Documents** - Get approval for pre-qualification requirements
7. **Advertise & Issue Pre-Qualification Documents** - Publish and distribute pre-qualification documents
8. **Close Pre-Qualification Applications** - Set deadline for pre-qualification submissions
9. **Evaluate Pre-Qualification Applications** - Review and evaluate pre-qualification bids
10. **Approve Pre-Qualified Bidders** - Determine which bidders qualify to proceed

### **Phase 3: Bidding Process**
11. **Issue Bid Documents** - Provide bidding documents to qualified bidders
12. **Receive Clarifications/Complaints** - Handle inquiries and issues from bidders
13. **Pre-Bid Meeting** - Conduct meeting with potential bidders
14. **Scrutinize (TEC/PC)** - Review and scrutinize the process
15. **Issue Addenda** - Provide any amendments or clarifications to bidding documents

### **Phase 4: Bid Submission and Evaluation**
16. **Receive & Open Bids** - Collect and publicly open bids
17. **Bid Evaluation** - Evaluate submitted bids according to established criteria

### **Phase 5: Award and Finalization**
18. **PC Determination** - Procurement Committee makes award determination
19. **Open for Appeal** - Allow for appeals from bidders
20. **Final Award** - Complete the contract award process

## **Key Decision Points**
- **Pre-Qualification Required?** (Yes/No) - Determines if pre-qualification phase is needed
- **Appeals Filed?** (Yes/No) - Triggers appeal procedures if needed
- **Funds Available?** (Yes/No) - Ensures funding is in place before proceeding

## **Important Considerations**
- The process is designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and competition
- Each step must be completed before moving to the next
- Procurement committees play a crucial role in oversight and approval
- The timeline must be carefully planned to ensure timely delivery of goods/services

This systematic approach ensures that procurement is conducted efficiently, transparently, and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations."

   - Inland transportation costs
   - Domestic preference applications

2. **Quality Checks:**
   - Examination for unbalanced bidding
   - Post-qualification verification of lowest evaluated bidder
   - Review of clarifications made during evaluation

### **Bid Evaluation Report Requirements**

After evaluation completion, a comprehensive bid evaluation report must be prepared including:

- Key dates and steps in bidding process

This structured approach ensures that bid evaluation is conducted fairly, transparently, and in accordance with established procurement principles and regulations."
1,10:10:55,can we award  to the second lowest bidder with justifications?,"
Based on the procurement guidelines, awarding to the second lowest bidder is generally **not the standard procedure**, but there are specific circumstances where it may be considered. Here's the breakdown:

## **General Rule**
The standard principle is: **""Whatever option is used the lowest evaluated bidder will be awarded the contract.""**

## **Exceptions Where Lowest Bidder Can Be Rejected**

The lowest bidder can be rejected under the following exceptional circumstances:

### **1. Performance and Capability Issues**
- If the bidder fails to provide acceptable justification/explanation for their bid
- If the bidder would likely fail to perform obligations within quoted rates
- If the bidder refuses to provide additional performance security when requested

### **2. Technical and Compliance Issues**
- **Major deviations** in bid submission (e.g., absence of signature on bid form)
- **Bid security violations** (insufficient amount, wrong form, insufficient period)
- **Non-responsiveness** to critical requirements

### **3. Market and Pricing Issues**
- **Unreasonably high prices** - if the lowest evaluated bid exceeds the engineer's estimate by a substantial margin
- **Lack of effective competition** - even if there's only one substantially responsive bid, price reasonableness must be examined

## **Recommended Actions Instead of Awarding to Second Lowest**

When the lowest bidder is problematic, the guidelines recommend these alternatives:

### **1. Negotiation**
- Negotiate with the lowest evaluated bidder to reduce scope or relocate risks
- Try to obtain a satisfactory contract through price reduction

### **2. Re-bidding**
- **Reject all bids** and initiate re-bidding with:
  - Modified bidding documents (if they were defective)
  - Wider advertising (if due to lack of competition)
  - Revised conditions, design, or specifications

### **3. Contract Modifications**
- Make revisions to contract conditions, design, specifications, or scope before inviting new bids

## **When Awarding to Second Lowest Might Be Considered**

While not explicitly stated as standard practice, awarding to the second lowest bidder could potentially be justified in these scenarios:

1. **Post-qualification failure** of the lowest bidder
2. **Material deviations** discovered after bid opening that make the lowest bidder non-responsive
3. **Unbalanced bidding** that creates unacceptable risks
4. **Technical deficiencies** that emerge during evaluation

## **Required Documentation**

If considering awarding to the second lowest bidder, you would need to document:
- Specific reasons for rejecting the lowest bidder
- Evidence that the rejection is justified under exceptional circumstances
- Confirmation that the second bidder meets all requirements
- Approval from the appropriate procurement committee

## **Important Considerations**

- **Transparency**: Any deviation from the standard process must be fully documented and justified
- **Due Process**: The procurement committee must approve any non-standard award decisions
- **Appeals**: Unsuccessful bidders may challenge the decision, so thorough documentation is crucial

**In summary**: While the preference is to award to the lowest evaluated bidder, there are legitimate circumstances where the lowest bidder can be rejected. However, awarding directly to the second lowest bidder is not typically the first recommended approach - re-bidding or negotiation are usually preferred alternatives."
