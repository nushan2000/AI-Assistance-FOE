[Search only in: Student handbook]","
Based on the student handbook search results, here are the minimum credit requirements:

**For Specialization Courses:**
- A minimum of **18 total credits** are required to register for specialization courses.

**For Subject Categories:**
- **Engineering Design and Projects**: Minimum 8 credits required
- **Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts and Engineering Ethics**: Minimum 5 credits required

**Important Notes:**
- Students who fail to obtain the minimum 18 credits due to medical or other acceptable reasons can seek approval from the Faculty Board for academic concession.
- The 18-credit requirement applies to the 2022/2023 academic year (24th Batch).
- When calculating the mean SGPA for merit lists, Grade Point Values for Grades N and W are taken as zero.

The specific category requirements (8 credits for Engineering Design and Projects, 5 credits for Humanities/Social Sciences/Arts/Ethics) appear to be in addition to the overall 18-credit minimum for specialization registration."
